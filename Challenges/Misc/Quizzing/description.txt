The flag will be composed of the small letters (in order) representing the answers. The format is "THICTF{(the letters)}". If, for example, the answers to questions 1. to 6. would be a) and the last answer would be d), the flag would be: THICTF{aaaaaad}
Attention, you only get three flag-submit attempts, so trying out many combinations will be your doom.
